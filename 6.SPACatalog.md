>Make a project of catalog-like SPA. It must have 3 types of users: buyers (explore, buy), sellers (add, sell), admins (all possible + extras) and implement basic trading with any payment provider.
We expect you to do the following:
Architecture diagram, could be UML-like;
Js classes drafts;
Detailed plan on building Access control system.


It was not allowed to use a framework for implementation, so I've chosen the MVP pattern for the architecture. The UML class diagram is displayed on the picture below. The JS classes drafts:
* [Models](SPACatalog/models.js)
* [Views](SPACatalog/views.js)
* [Presenters](SPACatalog/presenters.js)

The app consists of "Catalog", "Transactions", "Add Item", "Purchase Item" pages. A buyer can view the catalog and purchase items, a seller can view the catalog and add new items to it. An admin can do everything. There are 2 facets of Access control system : 
* On the client-side display only allowed UI items for a user. For example a buyer can't add an item in the catalog, so "Add New" button should not be visible for a user with this role. This could be achieved by introducing "capabilities" for a current logged-in user and filter the UI based on them. The capabilities are provided by requesting a server for. The draft of this functionality can be found at [store.js](SPACatalog/store.js). Store is the class that provides the data for an app and normally it would send requests to the server. The [catalog presenter](SPACatalog/presenters.js) accesses the capabilities data via [catalog model](SPACatalog/models.js) and decides whether to show "add new..." link. The same technique could be used to hide "Purchase Item" for sellers or hide the links to admin page for non-admin users.
* Even if the client-side is altered and a hacker was able to access the hidden UI, the requests for the data on the server-side should check whether the current user's role is allowed to access the related resources. Role-based Access control is well-known technique to achieve that.
