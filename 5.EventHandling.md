>How do you prefer to implement event handling using pure JavaScript? 

My favorite way of handling DOM events is using the notion of Event Flow and namely its Bubbling phase. This is especially useful when a handler needs to intercept the certain event that could be raised by multiple elements - this is what task#1[LINK] was about. In that case, instead of adding the event handler for each and every element, the code can attach the single handler to the closest common ancestor of those elements. This approach has a couple of advantages:
* The handler will work for dynamic elements that are added at runtime
* Single handler instead of multiple handlers is less expensive from the performance perspective.

But there are disadvantages as well:
* If the closest common ancestor is the ```body``` element, then attaching the event handler to it might negatively impact the page performance because the handler's code will be invoked for each and every element on the page(unless other handler prevents the event from bubbling).
* If there are multiple handlers of the same event attached to various parts of the page, then the event bubbling might be cancelled in one of the handler and never reach the expected one.

The pure JavaScript sample can be found in task#1[LINK] implementation.

Previously I used jQuery's event delegation feature that basically works the same way, here is the simple example:
```html
<ul id='task_list'>
  <li data-status='done'>Task 1</li>
  <li data-status='pending'>Task 2</li>
  <li data-status='in progress'>Task 3</li>
  <li data-status='done'>Task 4</li>
  <li data-status='pending'>Task 5</li>
</ul>
```
```javascript
$('#task_list').on('click', 'li', function(ev){
  var target = $(ev.target);
  console.log('Name: ', target.html());
  console.log('Status: ', target.attr('data-status'));
});
```
Another implementation of the same idea can be found in React.js framework. The React component listens for all the registered events by using a single event handler.
```javascript
var HotelList = React.createClass({
	getInitialState : function(){
  	var list = [
    	{key:"bw", name : "Best Western Mediocre", price : "$100"},
    	{key: "hlt", name : "Hotel Hilton SuperB", price : "$500"}
    ];
    return {hotels : list};
  },
  render : function(){
  	function onClick(event){
      console.log(event.eventPhase); 
      // writes 3 meaning that the event phase is the bubbling phase, 
      // which proves that event has been delegated
      console.log('Name: ', event.target.innerHTML);
      console.log('Price: ', event.target.getAttribute('data-price'));
    }
  	var hotels = this.state.hotels.map(function(hotelItem){
    	return(
		<li data-price={hotelItem.price} key={hotelItem.key} onClick={onClick}
			{hotelItem.name}
		</li>
		);
    })
    return <ul id='hotelList'>{hotels}</ul>
  }
})

ReactDOM.render(<HotelList />, document.getElementById("container"));
```
