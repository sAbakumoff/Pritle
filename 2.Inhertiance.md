Until recently JavaScript didn't have a notion of "class" and "inheritance", but there are multiple language features that allow to imitate the Object Oriented Programming:
* "this" keyword
* "new" operator
* the chain of object prototypes

Here is a simple example of inheritance implementation
```javascript
function Element(){
  this._attributes = {};
}
Element.prototype = {
  attr : function(name, value){
    if(arguments.length === 1)
      return this._attributes[name];
    if(arguments.length === 2)
      this._attributes[name] = value;
  }
}

function ContentElement(content){
  Element.call(this);
  this._content=content;
}

ContentElement.prototype = Object.create(Element.prototype);

ContentElement.prototype.content = function(value){
  if(arguments.length===0) 
    return this._content;
  this._content = value;
}

var el = new ContentElement("welcome to the rabbit hole");

el.attr('class', 'title')
console.log(el.attr('class')); // writes "title"
console.log(el.content()); // writes "welcome to the rabbit hole"
```
Let's glance at the internals of "el" object:

![inheritance](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sAbakumoff/Pritle/master/images/inheritance.png "Chain of prototypes")

This quite complex structure was built by invoking ```var el = new ContentElement("welcome to the rabbit hole");``` Here is the tentative sequence of events that led to the observed outcome

1. The new object has been created out of thin air.
2. Internal [[Prototype]] property of the newly created object has been set to ContentElement.prototype that is in turn the object whose internal [[Prototype]] property is set to Element.prototype. That was achieved by ```ContentElement.prototype = Object.create(Element.prototype);``` call. This is how chain of prototypes in the picture above came to existence.
3. Function Element has been called with "this" referencing to the newly created object. This is how "_attributes" property has been set.
4. "_content" property has been set for newly created object.
5. The new object has been returned by ContentElement function. 

Here is what happens when the "inherited" attr method is called in line ```el.attr("class", "title")```

1. Runtime looks for "attr" property of el object itself and does not find it.
2. Runtime looks for "attr" property of el.[[Prototype]] object and does not find it.
3. Runtime looks for "attr" property of el.[[Prototype]].[[Prototype]] and finally finds it!
4. Runtime calls attr function with "this" context referencing to el object.

Basically it's doing the same as ```el.__proto__.__proto__.attr.call(el, "class", "title")``` would do. 
This is why it's called "prototypical inheritance" - it's completely based on the chain of prototypes feature. 

The advantage of this approach is in that it allows to imitate OOP, quite simply, even without any built-in OOP features. For example, virtual functions:
```javascript
function C(){}
C.prototype={
  foo : function(){
    this.bar();
  },
  bar : function(){
    console.log('c');
  }
}

function D(){}
D.prototype = Object.create(C.prototype);
D.prototype.bar = function(){
  console.log('d');
}

function E(){}
E.prototype = Object.create(C.prototype);
E.prototype.bar = function(){
  console.log('e');
}

var d = new D();
var e = new E();
d.foo(); // writes "d"
e.foo(); //writes "e"
```
There are disadvantages though:

* Lack of consistency. there is no single, well-known way to implement the inheritance. Even the code shown here can be writen differently to achieve the same result. 3rd party frameworks could offer various utilities to implement inhertiance.
* Lack of encapsulation. it's not possible to split a "class" methods to private and protected to hide the implementation details where it's necessary.
* Lack of runtime safety. "Inhertied" methods are located in the chain of prototypes and can be altered at any moment, for example if the line ```delete C.prototype.foo``` is called, then d.foo() and e.foo() will produce the error.

In ES6 the lack of consistency has been solved by brining the explicit syntax for classes and inhertitance:
```javascript
class Element{
  constructor(){
    this._attributes = {};
  }
  attr(name, value){
    if(arguments.length === 1)
      return this._attributes[name];
    this._attributes[name] = value;
  }
}

class ContentElement extends Element{
  constructor(content){
    super();
    this._content = content;
  }
  content(){
    return this._content;
  }
}

var el = new ContentElement('Welcome to the rubbit hole!');
el.attr('class', 'title'); 
console.log(el.attr('class')); // writes "title"
console.log(el.content()); // writes "welcome to the rabbit hole"
```
However, this is, mostly, the syntactic sugar on top of the prototypical inheritance described above and it works, mostly, the same way. The advantages of this solution:

* Standardized and nice syntax
* "super" keyword that allows to call the methods of the "base" object

The lack of runtime safety hasn't been fixed though. It's still possible to alter the chain of prototypes and break the "inheritance", i.e. for example above ```delete Element.prototype.attr```
Also, it's still not possible to declare private and protected methods.
