Until recently JavaScript didn't have a notion of "class" and "inheritance", but there are multiple language features that allow to imitate the Object Oriented Programming:
* "this" keyword
* "new" operator
* the chain of object prototypes

Here is a simple example of inheritance implementation
```javascript
function Element(){
  this._attributes = {};
}
Element.prototype = {
  attr : function(name, value){
    if(arguments.length === 1)
      return this._attributes[name];
    if(arguments.length === 2)
      this._attributes[name] = value;
  }
}

function ContentElement(content){
  Element.call(this);
  this._content=content;
}

ContentElement.prototype = Object.create(Element.prototype);

ContentElement.prototype.content = function(value){
  if(arguments.length===0) 
    return this._content;
  this._content = value;
}

var el = new ContentElement("welcome to the rabbit hole");

el.attr("class", "title")
console.log(el.attr('class')); // writes "title"
console.log(el.content()); // writes "welcome to the rabbit hole"
```
Let's glance at the internals of "el" object:

![inheritance](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sAbakumoff/Pritle/master/images/inheritance.png "Chain of prototypes")

This quite complex structure was built by invoking ```var el = new ContentElement("welcome to the rabbit hole");``` Here is the tentative sequence of events that led to the observed outcome

1. The new object has been created out of thin air.
2. Internal [[Prototype]] property of the newly created object has been set to ContentElement.prototype that is in turn the object whose internal [[Prototype]] property is set to Element.prototype. That was achieved by ```ContentElement.prototype = Object.create(Element.prototype);``` call. This is how chain of prototypes in the picture above came to existence.
3. Function Element has been called with "this" referencing to the newly created object. This is how "_attributes" property has been set.
4. "_content" property has been set for newly created object.
5. The new object has been returned by ContentElement function. 

Here is what happens when the "inherited" attr method is called in line ```el.attr("class", "title")```

1. Runtime looks for "attr" property of el object itself and does not find it.
2. Runtime looks for "attr" property of el.[[Prototype]] object and does not find it.
3. Runtime looks for "attr" property of el.[[Prototype]].[[Prototype]] and finally finds it!
4. Runtime calls attr function with "this" context referencing to el object.

Basically it's doing the same as ```el.__proto__.__proto__.attr.call(el, "class", "title")``` would do. 
This is why it's called "prototypical inheritance" - it's completely based on the chain of prototypes feature.
